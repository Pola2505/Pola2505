# Hello, I'm Sandra Popielarczyk ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Transforming complexity into clarity through data. 

Iâ€™ve spent the past 6 years working as a Data Analyst, helping teams make smarter decisions by translating raw data into clear, meaningful insights. I'm confident working with SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools like Power BI, Looker, Quicksight or Tableau. I also use Python and am currently focused on becoming more professional with it to handle more advanced analysis and automation tasks with Pandas, Jupyter, Matplotlib and Seaborn mostly.

Iâ€™ve always loved logic and solving problems - itâ€™s what drew me to data in the first place. My passion for technology and programming drove me to study Python and its applications in data analysis and IA.

I'm driven by the conviction that data, when expertly leveraged, holds incredible power. My passion lies in transforming complex information into clear, actionable insights, empowering others to make a real difference, and streamlining operations through data automation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web application for tracking my finances, so stay tuned!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my front-end career in ADA ITW and growing as a back-end developer focused on data analysis
- âš¡ Fact: as I child I loved to spend a whole day in front of the computer and play with the code from forums that used to be very famous at that time ( I also created one ) but not until I got older and moved to another country I realized that programming is the thing that inspires me and fascinates me, and the thing that the learning process never stops makes me even more excited about it!
