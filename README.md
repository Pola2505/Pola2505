- 🔭 I’m currently working on a web application for tracking my finances, so stay tuned!
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my front-end career in ADA ITW, aspiring also to start with back end immediately ! 
- ⚡ Fact: as I child I loved to spend a whole day in front of the computer and play with the code from forums that used to be very famous at that time ( I also created one ) but not until I got older and moved to another country I realized that programming is the thing that inspires me and fascinates me, and the thing that the learning process never stops makes me even more excited...
